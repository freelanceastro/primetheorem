A visualization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, using D3.js. This was my first D3 project, and my first project of any serious size in JavaScript (not to mention my first real website), so there's a fair amount of weird crap in the code. But it gets the job done, it works on both mobile and desktop browsers pretty well, and I've commented it to hell and back to make it clear what's going on.
